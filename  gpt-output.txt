Sure! Here's how you can define a Terraform configuration using the official Terraform Docker provider to create the pgvector container 
and the Flask app container.

First, you need to create a `provider.tf` file to specify the Docker provider:

```hcl
# provider.tf
run/docker.sock"
}provider "docker" {
  host = "unix:///var/
```

Next, create a `main.tf` file to define the resources (containers, images, and networks):

```hcl
 
```

Here's what the configuration does:

1. Defines the Docker provider to use Unix sockets to communicate with the Docker daemon.
2. Creates a Docker image resource for pgvector and a Docker container resource using that image.
3. Creates a Docker image resource for the Flask app (note that you should build and create the image of your Flask app beforehand).
4. Creates a Docker container resource for the Flask app using the app's Docker image and links it to the pgvector container.

To run the Terraform configuration, you need to:

1. Build your Flask app's Docker image:

   ```sh
   docker build -t your_flask_app_image:latest .
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform in the directory that contains your `provider.tf` and `main.tf`:

   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

3. Apply the Terraform configuration to create the Docker resources:

   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

This will start both (pgvector and Flask app) containers using Terraform with the specified configurations.
